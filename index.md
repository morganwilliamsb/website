Bethan Morgan-Williams (1992-) is a composer who writes quirky, rhythmically-intricate music, finding motivation in the apogee of musical performance. Described as “marvellously oblique and obscure” [5against4] while being “rooted in something ancient and folky” [The Telegraph], Bethan’s music plays with expectation and variance.
