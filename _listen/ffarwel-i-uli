### *Ffarwel i Uli* (2023)

*for violin and Moogerfooger*

*Ffarwel i Uli* is written in memory of Ulrich Löffler — a cherished member of Ensemble Musikfabrik and the partner of violinist Hannah Weirich. The Welsh title, meaning “Farewell to Uli”, reflects the bittersweet act of bidding goodbye to someone who brought beauty, warmth, and joy into the world.

The piece unfolds as a poignant, enigmatic tapestry shaped by a cyclic structure: fragments that hint at a larger whole while remaining elusive, like memories that are incomplete yet vividly present. It opens with the distant sound of news bulletins and sighing motifs, echoing the announcement of Uli’s passing and the collective shock and mourning that followed.

Through a rich interplay of acoustic and electronic sound, the work brings together the organic expressiveness of the violin and the surreal, otherworldly resonance of the Moogerfooger ring modulator. Extended techniques — including scratch tones, circular bowing, and playing behind the bridge — create layers of fragile texture, representing the collision of raw emotion and delicate remembrance.

A recurring pizzicato figure, reminiscent of a clock bell, marks the passage of time and underscores the finite nature of existence. Sudden shifts between percussive, mechanical gestures and moments of soaring lyricism mirror the emotional terrain of grief, celebration, and reflection.

Dedicated *“to Hannah, with love”*, *Ffarwel i Uli* is more than an elegy. It is a quiet embrace — a tribute to Uli’s spark, and a reminder to cherish the light he left behind.
