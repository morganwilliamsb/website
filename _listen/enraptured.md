### *Enraptured* (2015)

*for viola and piano*

*Enraptured* is a one-movement fantasy for viola and piano. It was premiered by Paul Silverthorne (viola) and Aglaia Tarantino (piano) on 30 January 2016 at LSO St Luke’s, London. This recording is taken from that concert.

> “This is essentially rustic, cheeky music — energetic and entrancing, with a moment of repose about two-thirds of the way through. The players work together initially, and then adopt a more conversational role.”
