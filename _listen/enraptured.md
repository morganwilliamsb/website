Enraptured (2015) is a one-movement fantasy for viola and piano. It was premiered by Paul Silverthorne & Aglaia Tarantino on 30 January 2016, LSO St. Luke’s (London). This recording is taken from that concert.

>This is essentially rustic, cheeky music – energetic and entrancing, with a moment’s repose about two-thirds >of the way through. The players work together initially, and then adopt a more conversational role.”
