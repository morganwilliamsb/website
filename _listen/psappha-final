### *Voices Go With You* (2022)

*for flute, piano, percussion, and cello*

*Voices Go With You* unfolds as a tone poem in which a still, serene landscape is disrupted by restlessness and unease. States of calm and agitation coexist, negotiating a fragile balance as something darker remains concealed beneath the surface.

The work reflects on the shared ritual of concert-going: the transition from the private interior to the collective space of the auditorium, and the roles assumed by performers and audience alike. While the musicians may move — even dance — the audience remains still, bound to the measured time of the music. The piece asks how such conditions arise, and what tensions they quietly contain.

Based on lines from *Salt*, a recent collection of poems by David Harsent, *Voices Go With You* is a commemorative work written both for the ensemble Psappha and for Tim Williams, who stepped down as the ensemble’s director after thirty years at the end of the 2021–22 season.
