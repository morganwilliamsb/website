### *One, Two, Bakerloo…* (2020)

*for solo violin*

Intended as an encore piece, this bagatelle for solo violin is a minimalist collision of additive melody and techniques of metamorphosis. The title is derived from an unfinished poem featured in *The Little Book of Mornington Crescent*, which reads:

> *Nursery rhyme (sixteenth century) — unfinished:*  
> One, two Bakerloo,  
> Three, four,

*One, Two, Bakerloo…* was premiered live on YouTube by Fenella Humphreys on 10 June 2020 as part of her *Homemade Concert* series. It was later recorded by Rubicon Classics on the album *Prism*.
