### *Gêmdis* (2020)

*for E-flat clarinet and ensemble*

The title *Gêmdis* combines the Welsh words for “game” and “dice”, and — like a desperate gambler — Bethan Morgan-Williams’s piece for E-flat clarinet and ensemble keeps returning for another roll. Each new start takes the music through a different set of emotional states, from playful to down and dirty, from the still voice of conscience to the horns of a dilemma. Or does it keep returning to the same place?

Are things out of control, then — or not?

*Programme note by Tim Rutherford-Johnson.*

_Gêmdis_ was written for Ensemble Musikfabrik as part of the Composer Collider Europe programme.
