>"In the middle of the first Lockdown, Bethan, whom we had met at Composer Collider Europe, sent us a duo for >violin and piano, in case we knew what to do with it … The premiere, like so many things at that time, had >been cancelled.

>When, a short time later, the first tentative opportunities arose to give small concerts to a reduced audience >and our Concertini series was born, it was immediately clear to us that we wanted to premiere Datod and add it >to our repertoire.” – Hannah Weirich (violin)
