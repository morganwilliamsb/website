### *Datod* (2020)

*for violin and piano*

> “In the middle of the first lockdown, Bethan — whom we had met at Composer Collider Europe — sent us a duo for violin and piano, in case we knew what to do with it. The premiere, like so many things at that time, had been cancelled.
>
> When, a short time later, the first tentative opportunities arose to give small concerts to a reduced audience and our *Concertini* series was born, it was immediately clear to us that we wanted to premiere *Datod* and add it to our repertoire.”
>
> — Hannah Weirich (violin)
