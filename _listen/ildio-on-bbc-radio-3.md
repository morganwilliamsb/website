### *ILDIO* (2025)

*for ensemble*

*ILDIO* — meaning *surrender* — explores musical emergence through a process of gradual filtration. The piece begins with twelve superimposed layers, which are progressively removed until a single, coherent thread remains. Rather than presenting a fixed argument, the piece invites the listener to witness the difficulty of arriving at clarity: a journey through density, uncertainty, and instability towards something more focused.

The opening texture is intentionally overloaded, with all players active at once. This density reflects a state of excess — competing ideas, simultaneous trajectories — before any hierarchy has been established. As the piece unfolds, the texture thins section by section, allowing space, breath, and direction to emerge. The process of reduction becomes a metaphor for composing itself: listening through noise in order to discover what matters.
