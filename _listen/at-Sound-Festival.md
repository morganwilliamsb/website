### *In the Crypt* (2015)

*for horn and live electronics*

A brilliant audio-visual recording of *In the Crypt* — an interactive piece for horn and live electronics — realised by Ben Goldscheider (horn) and Pete Stollery (electronics). This is a poignant performance of a “ghosting” piece, and stands apart from previous renditions because of the way it was assembled.

Due to coronavirus restrictions, Ben was unable to travel to Aberdeen for the performance. It was therefore agreed that he would record his part in London, with the electronics overdubbed afterwards. This meant sacrificing the live manipulation of the horn, but the result feels unexpectedly complete — perhaps even gaining something in the process.

Recorded by Ben Goldscheider (horn) and Pete Stollery (electronics) for Sound Festival 2020, Aberdeen.
