### *Parti Di-ffiniau* (2023)

*for orchestra*

*Parti Di-ffiniau* (Party Without Borders) is a short orchestral fantasy that draws on the energy of Holst’s *Jupiter*, elaborating and transforming selected motifs through processes guided by numbers associated with the city of Birmingham. The piece opens with a near-quotation that immediately evokes the vigour of *Jupiter*: a running accompaniment constrained by a four-note figure passed between lower strings and brass.

As the work unfolds, a persistent, haunting call is introduced and gradually intensified. Following a more languid central section, earlier material is reconfigured through a tempo canon, driving towards a final, frenzied pastiche. The music is quick, energetic, bimodal, and polytemporal, embracing a sense of celebration and momentum.

**Performance / Recording**  
Performed by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Clark Rundell.
