In Kenopsia – an interactive piece for trombone & live electronics – is inspired by the experience of being present in a place that is usually bustling with life, but is now deserted. It is a duet between the known and visually-present trombonist and a violin. There is no violinist present though. Instead, all of the sounds used to comprise the samples in the electronics are taken from a single recording of a violinist improvising, and gradually over the course of the piece, the source of these exterior sounds becomes more apparent.

In Kenopsia was recorded live to video tape by Tony Boorer (trombone) and Bethan Morgan-Williams (electronics) on 5 May 2017 at Hallé St. Michael’s, Manchester.
