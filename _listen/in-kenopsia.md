### *In Kenopsia* (2017)

*for trombone and live electronics*

*In Kenopsia* — an interactive piece for trombone and live electronics — is inspired by the experience of being present in a place that is usually bustling with life but is now deserted. The work unfolds as a duet between the known, visually present trombonist and a violin — though no violinist appears on stage. Instead, all of the sounds used in the electronics are derived from a single recording of a violinist improvising. Over the course of the piece, the source of these exterior sounds gradually becomes more apparent.

**Performance / Recording**  
Recorded live to videotape by Tony Boorer (trombone) and Bethan Morgan-Williams (electronics) on 5 May 2017 at Hallé St Michael’s, Manchester.
