> “Like a thornbush brandished by the hand of a drunkard  
> is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.”

> — *Proverbs 26:9* (New Revised Standard Version)

*A Thornbush In My Strength* was written in 2013 for House of Bedlam percussionist Delia Stevens and received its premiere later that year. The work was subsequently taken up by Neil Percy (Principal Percussion, London Symphony Orchestra), whose striking and playful interpretation is presented here.

The recording was made live at the LSO Soundhub Showcase at LSO St Luke’s on Saturday 15 February 2020.
