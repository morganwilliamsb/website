>Like a thornbush brandished by the hand of a drunkard is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.
> <cite>Proverbs 26:9, New Revised Standard</cite>

A Thornbush In My Strength was written in 2013 for House of Bedlam percussionist Delia Stevens. It received its premiere in the October of that year and was recently picked up by Neil Percy (Principal Percussion, LSO). Neil’s version is striking and fun, and is available to watch via this post. The recording is taken from a Soundhub concert at LSO St. Luke’s on 15 February 2020.
