### *Gêmdis* (2020)

*for E-flat clarinet and ensemble*

The title *Gêmdis* combines the Welsh words for “game” and “dice”, and — like a desperate gambler — Bethan Morgan-Williams’s piece for E-flat clarinet and ensemble keeps returning for another roll. Each new start takes the music through a different set of emotional states, from playful to down and dirty, from the still voice of conscience to the horns of a dilemma. Or does it keep returning to the same place?

Are things out of control, then — or not?

*Gêmdis* was written as part of the Composer Collider Europe programme for Carl Rosman and Ensemble Musikfabrik.

**Performance / Recording**  
Performed by Carl Rosman (E-flat clarinet) with Ensemble Musikfabrik (cond. Christian Eggen).
