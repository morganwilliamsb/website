### *Trying to Use Words* (2025)

*for singing harpist and dancer*

*Trying to Use Words* is a work for singing harpist and dancer that explores relationships between voice, instrument, movement, and sound. The piece draws on T. S. Eliot’s *East Coker*, addressing the difficulty of communication and the ways in which meaning emerges through repetition, dependency, and partial failure.

The work treats expression as a relational process rather than an individual act. Musical and physical gestures are interdependent, with each performer responding to and shaping the actions of the other. Meaning is presented as provisional and contingent, formed through interaction rather than resolution.

Written in 2025, *Trying to Use Words* is dedicated to Jenna Vergeynst and originated as an offshoot of the project *Liaisons*. This recording presents the work without the dancer.
