### *Gêmdisyn* (2021)

*for solo E-flat clarinet*

The word *Gêmdis* combines the Welsh words for “game” and “dice”. *Gêmdisyn* — the suffix *-yn* designating in Welsh a singular thing found in the natural world — is based on the solo E-flat clarinet part of *Gêmdis* (2020), composed for Carl Rosman and Ensemble Musikfabrik.

Rather than functioning as a straightforward extraction, *Gêmdisyn* reshapes and reorders its source material, discarding some sections entirely and transforming others. While *Gêmdis* moved through multiple emotional states, *Gêmdisyn* alternates between two contrasting modes: a whimsical, skipping chatter and a fiery, unstable loss of control. A central passage of fragile harmonics and deliberately audible air sounds — marked *mechanical* — interrupts this alternation, introducing a sense of fragile clarity before the work concludes.

*Programme note by Tim Rutherford-Johnson.*

*Gêmdisyn* was commissioned by Ensemble Musikfabrik and written for Carl Rosman.
