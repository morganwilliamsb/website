Double Double – or Epsilon Lyrae – is a multiple star system in the constellation of Lyra (the harp). The legend of Lyra tells the story of Orpheus, who was given a lyre by Apollo and proceeded to sculpt a music that was sweeter than that of any other mortal man. Orpheus’ music was so powerful that it could charm even inaminate objects like trees, rocks and stars.

Each of the two stars in the Epsilon Lyrae system is, in itself, a double star. The system is a single point of light to the eye but, it is really four distinct stars. One stellar pair circles around the other stellar pair in an intricate gravitational dance. They appear spellbound, delighting in a dreamboat display of begirdling resonance.


Double Double (2018) is a string quartet that was written for Equilibrium Ensemble and dedicated to cellist, Hilary Browning. Details of the recording can be found via the Soundcloud link.
